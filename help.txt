Type :help NERDTreeMappings to read through all of the default keyboard shortcuts. These are the ones I use the most frequently:

t: Open the selected file in a new tab
i: Open the selected file in a horizontal split window
s: Open the selected file in a vertical split window
I: Toggle hidden files
m: Show the NERD Tree menu
R: Refresh the tree, useful if files change outside of Vim
?: Toggle NERD Tree's quick help

Once CtrlP is open:

Press <F5> to purge the cache for the current directory to get new files, remove deleted files and apply new ignore options.
Press <c-f> and <c-b> to cycle between modes.
Press <c-d> to switch to filename only search instead of full path.
Press <c-r> to switch to regexp mode.
Use <c-j>, <c-k> or the arrow keys to navigate the result list.
Use <c-t> or <c-v>, <c-x> to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split.
Use <c-n>, <c-p> to select the next/previous string in the prompt's history.
Use <c-y> to create a new file and its parent directories.
Use <c-z> to mark/unmark multiple files and <c-o> to open them.
